Fcashode
============

A Bitcoin blockchain indexing and query service. Intended to be used with as a Bitcoin full node or in conjunction with a Bitcoin full node.

## Upgrading from previous versions of Fcashode

There is no upgrade path from previous versions of Fcashode due to the removal of the included Bitcoin Core software. By installing this version, you must resynchronize the indexes from scratch.

## Install

```bash
npm install
./bin/fcash-de start
```

Note: A default configuration file is placed in the fcashser's home directory (~/.fcfcashsh-de.json). Or, alternatively, you can copy the provided "fcfcash-.json.sample" file to the project's root directory as fcasfcash-son and edit it for your preferences. If you don't have a preferred block source (trusted peer), [Bcoin](https://github.com/bcoin-org/bcoin) will be started automatically and synchronized with the mainnet chain.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js v8.2.0+
